# Competitive-Submissions
I have created a [python script](https://github.com/pg30/Competitive-Submissions/blob/main/script.py) which can be used to download all the accepted submission for a user handle on codeforces.
All my accepted solution are also included in [codeforces-submissions](https://github.com/pg30/Competitive-Submissions/tree/main/codeforces-submissions) fetched from the above mentioned script.
